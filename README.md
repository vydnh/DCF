# Python for Finance 
This is a personal project where Iâ€™m trying to find how Python can be used for financial analysis. 
# About This Project
The goal is to build a custom stock screener that filters stocks based on key financial metrics, and performs a simple stock valuation using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method.

Key features include:

1. Fetching stock data (prices, financial statements, statistics)

2. Visualizing data with charts
    
3. Building valuation models
    
4. Exporting data to Excel for easy presentation
