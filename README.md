# Python for Finance 
This repository contains Python code for financial data analysis and modelling. 
# About This Project
The goal is to build a custom stock screener that filters stocks based on key financial metrics, and performs a simple stock valuation using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method.

Key features include:

    Fetching stock data (prices, financial statements, statistics)
    Visualizing data with charts
    Building valuation models
    Exporting data to Excel for easy presentation
    

This project is a hands-on way for me to experiment with Python in financial analysis.
